Help on function writer in module safer:

wwrriitteerr(stream, is_binary=None, close_on_exit=False)
    Write safely to file streams, sockets and callables.
    
    ``safer.writer`` yields an in-memory stream that you can write
    to, but which is only written to the original stream if the
    context finished without raising an exception.
    
    Because the actual writing happens when the context exits, it's possible
    to block indefinitely if the underlying socket, stream or callable does.
    
    ARGUMENTS
      stream:
        A file stream, a socket, or a callable that will receive data
    
      is_binary:
        Is ``stream`` a binary stream?
    
        If ``is_binary`` is ``None``, deduce whether it's a binary file from
        the stream, or assume it's text otherwise.
Help on function open in module safer:

ooppeenn(name, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None, follow_symlinks=True, make_parents=False, delete_failures=True, temp_file=False)
    A drop-in replacement for ``open()`` which returns a stream which only
    overwrites the original file when close() is called, and only if there was
    no failure
    
    If a stream ``fp`` return from ``safer.open()`` is used as a context
    manager and an exception is raised, the property ``fp.safer_failed`` is
    set to ``True``.
    
    In the method ``fp.close()``, if ``fp.safer_failed`` is *not* set, then the
    temporary file is moved over the original file, successfully completing the
    write.
    
    If ``fp.safer_failed`` is true, then if ``delete_failures`` is true, the
    temporary file is deleted.
    
    
    If the ``mode`` argument contains either ``'a'`` (append), or ``'+'``
    (update), then the original file will be copied to the temporary file
    before writing starts.
    
    Note that ``safer`` uses an extra temporary file which is renamed over the
    file only after the stream closes without failing.  This uses as much disk
    space as the old and new files put together.
    
    ARGUMENTS
      make_parents:
        If true, create the parent directory of the file if it doesn't exist
    
      delete_failures:
        If true, the temporary file is deleted if there is an exception
    
      follow_symlinks:
        If true, overwrite the file pointed to and not the symlink
    
      temp_file:
        If true use a disk file and os.rename() at the end, otherwise
        cache the writes in memory.  If it's a string, use this as the
        name of the temporary file, otherwise select one in the same
        directory as the target file, or in the system tempfile for streams
        that aren't files.
    
    The remaining arguments are the same as for built-in ``open()``.

    A context manager that yields a function that prints to the opened file,
    only overwriting the original file at the exit of the context,
    and only if there was no exception thrown

    ✏️safer: a safer file opener ✏️
    -------------------------------
    
    No more partial writes or corruption! For file streams, sockets or
    any callable.
    
    Install ``safer`` from the command line with pip
    (https://pypi.org/project/pip): ``pip install safer``.
    
    Tested on Python 3.4 and 3.8
    For Python 2.7, use https://github.com/rec/safer/tree/v2.0.5
    
    See the Medium article `here. <https://medium.com/@TomSwirly/%EF%B8%8F-safer-a-safer-file-writer-%EF%B8%8F-5fe267dbe3f5>`_
    
    ``safer`` does not force atomic writing of files!  It is aimed at preventing
    corrupt files, streams, socket connections or similar, but from to a programmer
    error, not because of concurrent modification of files from other threads or
    processes.  See https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites/ if you need atomic file
    writing.
    
    * ``safer.writer()`` wraps an existing writer or socket and writes a whole
      response or nothing, by caching written data in memory
    
    * ``safer.open()`` is a drop-in replacement for built-in ``open`` that
      writes a whole file or nothing by caching written data on disk.
      Unfortunately, disk caching does not work on Windows.
    
    * ``safer.closer()`` returns a stream like from ``safer.write()`` that also
      closes the underlying stream or callable when it closes.
    
    * ``safer.printer()`` is ``safer.open()`` except that it yields a
      a function that prints to the stream.  Like ``safer.open()``, it
      unfortunately does not work on Windows.
    
    ------------------
    
    ``safer.open()``
    =================
    
    ``safer.open()`` writes a whole file or nothing. It's a drop-in replacement for
    built-in ``open()`` except that ``safer.open()`` leaves the original file
    unchanged on failure.
    
    EXAMPLE
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        # dangerous
        with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
            json.dump(data, fp)
            # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written
    
        # safer
        with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
            json.dump(data, fp)
            # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.
    
    
    ``safer.open(filename)`` returns a file stream ``fp`` like ``open(filename)``
    would, except that ``fp`` writes to a temporary file in the same directory.
    
    If ``fp`` is used as a context manager and an exception is raised, then
    ``fp.safer_failed`` is automatically set to ``True``. And when ``fp.close()``
    is called, the temporary file is moved over ``filename`` *unless*
    ``fp.safer_failed`` is true.
    
    ------------------------------------
    
    ``safer.writer()``
    ==================
    
    ``safer.writer()`` is like ``safer.open()`` except that it uses an existing
    writer, a socket, or a callback.
    
    EXAMPLE
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        sock = socket.socket(*args)
    
        # dangerous
        try:
            write_header(sock)
            write_body(sock)
            write_footer(sock)
         except:
            write_error(sock)  # You already wrote the header!
    
        # safer
        with safer.write(sock) as s:
            write_header(s)
            write_body(s)
            write_footer(s)
         except:
            write_error(sock)  # Nothing has been written
    
    ``safer.printer()``
    ===================
    
    ``safer.printer()`` is similar to ``safer.open()`` except it yields a function
    that prints to the open file - it's very convenient for printing text.
    
    Like ``safer.open()``, if an exception is raised within its context manager,
    the original file is left unchanged.
    
    EXAMPLE
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        # dangerous
        with open(file, 'w') as fp:
            for item in items:
                print(item, file=fp)
            # Prints lines until the first exception
    
        # safer
        with safer.printer(file) as print:
            for item in items:
                print(item)
            # Either the whole file is written, or nothing
