ðŸ§¿ safer: a safer writer for files and streams ðŸ§¿

Avoid partial writes or corruption!

`safer` wraps file streams and sockets so the data is written or sent only at
the successful completion of an entire computation, and offers a drop-in
replacement for regular old `open()`.

## Quick summary

### A tiny example

    import safer

    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        fp.write('one')

        if something_bad_happened():
            raise ValueError
            # The file is not changed

        print('two', file=fp)

     # The file only gets overwritten here.

### How to use

Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) to install `safer` from the command
line: `pip install safer`.

Tested on Python 3.4 - 3.11.  An old Python 2.7 version
is [here](https://github.com/rec/safer/tree/v2.0.5).

See the Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@TomSwirly/\
%EF%B8%8F-safer-a-safer-file-writer-%EF%B8%8F-5fe267dbe3f5)

### The details

`safer` helps prevent programmer error from corrupting files, socket
connections, or generalized streams by writing a whole file or nothing.

It does not prevent concurrent modification of files from other threads or
processes: if you need atomic file writing, see
https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites/

It also has a useful `dry_run` setting to let you test your code without
actually overwriting the target file.

* `safer.writer()` wraps an existing stream and writes a
  whole response or nothing, but does not close anything.

* `safer.closer()` is a `safer.writer()` that also closes the underlying
  stream.

* `safer.open()` is a drop-in replacement for built-in `open` that
  writes either a whole file or nothing on close of the file stream.

* `safer.dump()` is like a safer `json.dump()` which can be used for any
  serialization protocol, including Yaml and Toml, and also allows you to
  write to file streams or any other callable.

* `safer.printer()` is `safer.open()` except that it yields a
  a function that looks like `print`, but writers to the stream.

By default, `safer` buffers the written data in memory in a `io.StringIO`
or `io.BytesIO`.

For very large files, `safer.open()` has a `temp_file` argument which
writes the data to a temporary file on disk, which is moved over using
`os.rename` if the operation completes successfully.  This functionality
does not work on Windows.  (In fact, it's unclear if any of this works on
Windows, but that certainly won't.  Windows developer solicted!)


### Example: `safer.writer()`

`safer.writer()` wraps an existing stream - a writer, socket, or callback -
in a temporary stream which is only copied to the target stream at close(), and
only if no exception was raised.


    sock = socket.socket(*args)

    # dangerous
    try:
        write_header(sock)
        write_body(sock)   # Exception is thrown here
        write_footer(sock)
     except:
        write_error(sock)  # Oops, the header was already written

    # safer
    try:
        with safer.writer(sock) as s:
            write_header(s)
            write_body(s)  # Exception is thrown here
            write_footer(s)
     except:
        write_error(sock)  # Nothing has been written

### Example: `safer.open()`

Writes a whole file or nothing. It's a drop-in replacement for built-in
`open()` except that `safer.open()` leaves the original file unchanged on
failure.

    # dangerous
    with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written

    # safer
    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.


`safer.open(filename)` returns a file stream `fp` like `open(filename)`
would, except that `fp` writes to memory stream or a temporary file in the
same directory.

If `fp` is used as a context manager and an exception is raised, then the
property `fp.safer_failed` on the stream is automatically set to `True`.

And when `fp.close()` is called, the cached data is stored in `filename` -
*unless* `fp.safer_failed` is true.


### Example: `safer.dump()`

Serializes a whole file or nothing. It's a drop-in replacement for
`json.dump()` except:

* `safer.dump()` leaves the original file unchanged on
* It takes a filename in preference to an open file stream
* But it handles files, socket streams, or any callable

Dangerous.

    with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written

Safer.

    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.


`safer.open(filename)` returns a file stream `fp` like `open(filename)`
would, except that `fp` writes to memory stream or a temporary file in the
same directory.

If `fp` is used as a context manager and an exception is raised, then the
property `fp.safer_failed` on the stream is automatically set to `True`.

And when `fp.close()` is called, the cached data is stored in `filename` -
*unless* `fp.safer_failed` is true.

------------------------------------

### Example: `safer.printer()`

`safer.printer()` is similar to `safer.open()` except it yields a function
that prints to the open file - it's very convenient for printing text.

Like `safer.open()`, if an exception is raised within its context manager,
the original file is left unchanged.

    # dangerous
    with open(file, 'w') as fp:
        for item in items:
            print(item, file=fp)
        # Prints lines until the first exception

    # safer
    with safer.printer(file) as print:
        for item in items:
            print(item)
        # Either the whole file is written, or nothing

    Write safely to file streams, sockets and callables.

    `safer.writer` yields an in-memory stream that you can write
    to, but which is only written to the original stream if the
    context finishes without raising an exception.

    Because the actual writing happens at the end, it's possible to block
    indefinitely when the context exits if the underlying socket, stream or
    callable does!

    Args:
      stream: A file stream, a socket, or a callable that will receive data.

          If stream is `None`, output is written to `sys.stdout`

          If stream is a string or `Path`, the file with that name is
          opened for writing.

      is_binary: Is `stream` a binary stream?

          If `is_binary` is ``None``, deduce whether it's a binary file from
          the stream, or assume it's text otherwise.

      close_on_exit: If True, the underlying stream is closed when the writer
        closes

      temp_file: If `temp_file` is truthy, write to a disk file and use
          os.rename() at the end, otherwise cache the writes in memory.

          file, otherwise select one in the same directory as the target
          file, or in the system tempfile for streams that aren't files.

      chunk_size: Chunk size, in bytes for transfer data from the temporary
          file to the underlying stream.

      delete_failures: If false, any temporary files created are not deleted
        if there is an exception.

      dry_run: If `dry_run` is truthy, the stream or file is left unchanged.

        If `dry_run` is also callable, the results of the stream are passed to
        `dry_run()` rather than being written to the stream.

    The remaining arguments are the same as for built-in `open()`.

    `safer.open() is a drop-in replacement for built-in`open()`. It returns a
    stream which only overwrites the original file when close() is called, and
    only if there was no failure.

    It works as follows:

    If a stream `fp` return from `safer.open()` is used as a context
    manager and an exception is raised, the property `fp.safer_failed` is
    set to `True`.

    In the method `fp.close()`, if `fp.safer_failed` is *not* set, then the
    cached results replace the original file, successfully completing the
    write.

    If `fp.safer_failed` is true, then if `delete_failures` is true, the
    temporary file is deleted.

    If the `mode` argument contains either `'a'` (append), or `'+'`
    (update), then the original file will be copied to the temporary file
    before writing starts.

    Note that if the `temp_file` argument is set, `safer` uses an extra
    temporary file which is renamed over the file only after the stream closes
    without failing. This uses as much disk space as the old and new files put
    together.
