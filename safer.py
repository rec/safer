"""✏️safer: a safer file opener ✏️
-------------------------------

No more partial writes or corruption! For file streams, sockets or
any callable.

Install ``safer`` from the command line with pip
(https://pypi.org/project/pip): ``pip install safer``.

Tested on Python 3.4 and 3.8
For Python 2.7, use https://github.com/rec/safer/tree/v2.0.5

See the Medium article `here. <https://medium.com/@TomSwirly/\
%EF%B8%8F-safer-a-safer-file-writer-%EF%B8%8F-5fe267dbe3f5>`_

``safer`` does not force atomic writing of files!  It is aimed at preventing
corrupt files, streams, socket connections or similar, but from to a programmer
error, not because of concurrent modification of files from other threads or
processes.  See https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites/ if you need atomic file
writing.

* ``safer.writer()`` wraps an existing writer or socket and writes a whole
  response or nothing, by caching written data in memory

* ``safer.open()`` is a drop-in replacement for built-in ``open`` that
  writes a whole file or nothing by caching written data on disk.
  Unfortunately, disk caching does not work on Windows.

* ``safer.closer()`` returns a stream like from ``safer.write()`` that also
  closes the underlying stream or callable when it closes.

* ``safer.printer()`` is ``safer.open()`` except that it yields a
  a function that prints to the stream.  Like ``safer.open()``, it
  unfortunately does not work on Windows.

------------------

``safer.open()``
=================

``safer.open()`` writes a whole file or nothing. It's a drop-in replacement for
built-in ``open()`` except that ``safer.open()`` leaves the original file
unchanged on failure.

EXAMPLE

.. code-block:: python

    # dangerous
    with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written

    # safer
    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(data, fp)
        # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.


``safer.open(filename)`` returns a file stream ``fp`` like ``open(filename)``
would, except that ``fp`` writes to a temporary file in the same directory.

If ``fp`` is used as a context manager and an exception is raised, then
``fp.safer_failed`` is automatically set to ``True``. And when ``fp.close()``
is called, the temporary file is moved over ``filename`` *unless*
``fp.safer_failed`` is true.

------------------------------------

``safer.writer()``
==================

``safer.writer()`` is like ``safer.open()`` except that it uses an existing
writer, a socket, or a callback.

EXAMPLE

.. code-block:: python

    sock = socket.socket(*args)

    # dangerous
    try:
        write_header(sock)
        write_body(sock)
        write_footer(sock)
     except:
        write_error(sock)  # You already wrote the header!

    # safer
    with safer.write(sock) as s:
        write_header(s)
        write_body(s)
        write_footer(s)
     except:
        write_error(sock)  # Nothing has been written

``safer.printer()``
===================

``safer.printer()`` is similar to ``safer.open()`` except it yields a function
that prints to the open file - it's very convenient for printing text.

Like ``safer.open()``, if an exception is raised within its context manager,
the original file is left unchanged.

EXAMPLE

.. code-block:: python

    # dangerous
    with open(file, 'w') as fp:
        for item in items:
            print(item, file=fp)
        # Prints lines until the first exception

    # safer
    with safer.printer(file) as print:
        for item in items:
            print(item)
        # Either the whole file is written, or nothing
